The Roku Culture


Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

AKT (pronounced “act”) is The Personal Performance Company that may change your life. Founded by West End stars Ed Currie and Andy Coxon, AKT is by and for those who are “Born to Perform” — on the stage, at work, or in life.

 

In 2020, The Deodorant Balm made its stunning debut to rave reviews and awards from Vogue, GQ, Esquire, and Harper’s BAZAAR. Plastic-free, aluminium-free, and gender-free, The Deodorant Balm instantly resonated with those looking for a natural deodorant that genuinely worked. Five fragrances and over 200,000 happy armpits later, The Deodorant Balm is already becoming a household name.

 

To this day, every new AKT product is put through its paces by London’s hard-working theatre community to ensure it lives up to the high standards of its founders. As a rule, AKT’s products don’t break character — ever. It’s this effectiveness that has propelled AKT from the backstage to bathroom cabinets, bedside tables, duffel bags, and carry-on luggage worldwide. And the good news is — the performance is just getting started.

Analysis & Experimentation (35%)

Scope out, structure and deliver analysis that helps the business understand what is going on, focus on the right things, and make the right decisions
Be an advocate for data measurement and AB testing. Support teams to design and implement tests so that we can be sure of the impacts of what we do, and learn as much as possible  

 

Advanced Analytics / Projects (10%)

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Data Scientist (Business Operations)

The Business Operations Team at Wolt focuses on solving country- and region-specific marketplace challenges and is tasked with growing revenue and profitability. To do this, the team works to understand the underlying drivers of growth at the market level and identifies the best opportunities to have an impact.

We take on a diverse set of challenging questions in the geospatial, logistics, and economics spaces, focused on helping balance Wolt's multi-sided marketplace across an ecosystem of courier partners, customers, and merchant partners to achieve our topline and bottomline plans. Our work sees us optimizing the experience of our customers, contributing to providing growing income opportunities for our courier partners and merchants, and driving growth, efficiency, and profitability for Wolt overall.

We work with operations teams across 30 markets globally. Our core work covers customer retention, the economic efficiency of all our markets, and geospatial analysis - but our scope frequently expands to tackle issues beyond these topics.

The role

In this role, you will work closely with the regional leadership team, partnering with our General Managers and heads of operations and marketing in multiple markets.

This isn’t a normal Data Science role. You’ll combine strong technical skills and business acumen to partner with our regional leadership team. You will be the regional expert on connecting the dots across the business to help optimize our multi-sided marketplace. You will provide recommendations and consultation on business-critical issues through rigorous analysis paired with structured, big-picture thinking.

Day-to-day activities


Running data-driven research to uncover new insights and opportunities to help drive growth in the regions and fast track our operational strategy on a daily and weekly basis.
Working with Country GMs and Heads of Marketing and Operations to size and prioritize initiatives.
Some traveling to the local markets is expected.


About You

You’re not the typical Data Scientist. You have a passion for understanding the details behind the numbers and finding opportunities that really help the business hit its goals rather than building perfect models.

You understand how to balance rigor with speed and can help your business stakeholders navigate those tradeoffs as well.


3-5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or a related quantitative role.
Ability to delve into ambiguous problems for “treasure-hunting” with data and find creative new ways to think about our business.
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team.
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem-solving.
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python.
Ability to support & influence senior leadership in making critical decisions.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

577,Data Engineer (L5) - Conversation,Netflix,Utica-Rome Area,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-engineer-l5-conversation-at-netflix-4188391146,LinkedIn,2025-04-12,N/A,N/A,"Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with 283 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. Our members rely on Netflix to entertain them, and we want to be the first place they go for that entertainment. With an audience of 600M+ and growing, we’re programming for more tastes, cultures and languages than any company has ever done before. It’s why we invest in a wide variety of TV shows and films, and work so hard to make them great.

The reach of Netflix and the fandom we create fuels the “Netflix effect” - a virtuous cycle of great content and intense fandom that catapults our stories into the cultural conversation. Netflix influences what people around the world search for and talk about, the music they listen to, the books they read, the countries they visit, and how they dress.

Our marketing efforts help to kick start the Netflix effect, and we are providing more and more ways for fans to engage with our stores: Tudum, events like Netflix Bites and Bridgerton experiences, and the launch in 2025 of the first two Netflix House locations.

Netflix is a data-driven company, and we are hiring multiple data engineers to increase our data support for marketing and fandom activities around the world. The opportunity for impact in these roles is enormous: Netflix social media channels generate more than 100B impressions a year, we are expanding fandom into the real world, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the data available to support these activities.

What have you done and what do you know?


You have 8+ years of experience and proficiency building data pipelines in both batch and real-time settings, to support a variety of use cases. Some of our data sources are small (e.g., sales at Netflix House), and some are enormous (e.g., social media feeds). Our stack is Spark, Flink, Hive/Iceberg, Kafka - experience with these specific technologies is helpful, but not strictly required.
You are proficient in Python for scripting, automation, and data orchestration frameworks, and you can write complex SQL (any variant) for ad-hoc and recurring workflows. You strive to write elegant and maintainable code, and you're comfortable picking up new technologies.
You understand how to model data efficiently for reporting and metrics, and how to organize data for scale and fast retrieval.
You have experience sourcing and modeling data from application APIs.
You’ve worked with common data warehouse solutions, such as Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Vertica, Teradata, Greenplum, etc.


What will you do?


Fully own critical pipelines and data sets to support Netflix efforts around marketing and fandom.
Directly collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, model tables using data warehouse best practices, and develop data pipelines to ensure the timely delivery of high quality data.
Creatively explore how to use data to continually add value to Netflix. Translate ambiguous business questions into clear data requirements, and then deliver on them.
Be a bridge between data engineering and the business, enabling insights that empower our colleagues to make better and more informed decisions.
Build strong partnerships with data scientists, analytics engineers, and machine Learning practitioners to enable research and insight delivery for the business.


Who are you?


You want to live and breathe the Netflix Culture. Our ways of working are different, and you are excited to embrace and contribute to our culture.
You work quickly and independently while also collaborating effectively across functions (e.g. with marketing experts, data scientists, product managers).
You thrive in a fast paced environment, and see yourself as a partner with the business with the shared goal of moving the business forward.
You have a growth mindset, and expect the same from your colleagues. Not only talented, you are also curious, authentic, selfless, determined, and industrious. You generously give and receive candid feedback, to grow yourself and those around you.
You have strong beliefs that are weakly held: you can deliberate and hear all sides of a discussion, and adapt to new perspectives that emerge from it.
You are a sharp communicator who can break down and explain complex data problems in clear and concise language.
You are comfortable getting outside of your comfort zone, to explore new tech, make your own tools, or find new creative ways to address an old problem.


Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $170,000 - $720,000.

Netflix provides comprehensive benefits including Health Plans, Mental Health support, a 401(k) Retirement Plan with employer match, Stock Option Program, Disability Programs, Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts, Family-forming benefits, and Life and Serious Injury Benefits. We also offer paid leave of absence programs. Full-time hourly employees accrue 35 days annually for paid time off to be used for vacation, holidays, and sick paid time off.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
